# Welcome to the game of dice!

👀 Feel free to clone the repo. If you are intending to use bits of my code for your own, please let me know! I would be a happy camper knowing that someone else has a use for some of the code.

🎲 The game of dice is simple and consists of a 🙆🏼‍♂️person🙆🏼‍♀️ playing against the 🤖computer. The person and computer will each roll a pair of dice for 3 rounds. After the 3rd roll, the player with the highest score will win.

Scoring system works as follows:
- If any player's dice rolls as a 1, the score for that round is 0.
- If roll is the same pair, it will be added and multiplied by 2.
- If any other combination is rolled besides the above, the pair will be added as normal
